- title: Welcome to the radare2 web tutorial! Press 'enter' in the input box to open the crackme
  expect:
          input: o crackme
- title: To start we must learn the question mark ('?') Command that will show the list of root commands.
  expect:
          input: ?
- title: Some commands are used to interact with the user like the echo. Try ?e hello
  expect:
          output: hello

  expect:
          inputEndsWith: ?
- title: r2 is a block based hexadecimal editor. This means that you will only see a portion of the data. Use the 'b' comamnd to change the block size and run 'px' to print the block.
  expect:
          input: px
- title: You can also specify the block size as an argument to 'px'. As long as 'px' is too long, r2 provides a short for it: 'x'
  expect:
          input: x
- title: Numeric arguments in r2 can be complex math expressions using numbers in any base. Let's try to evaluate a math expression that computes to 6 using the ?v command.
  expect:
          output: 0x6
- title: Thanks for playing! This is a very early implementation. Feel free to submit PRs to extend the tutorials
  expect:
          input: restart
