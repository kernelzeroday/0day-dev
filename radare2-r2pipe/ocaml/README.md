# OCaml

OCaml r2pipe bindings are maintained at [fxfactorial/ocaml-radare2](https://github.com/fxfactorial/ocaml-radare2).
They are also published in opam repository as [`radare2`](https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/radare2).

Note, the lowest supported version of radare2 is **2.3.0** - it's the first that started to support
JSON r2pipe API consistently. Still, using newer versions is preferred.

You can install it with [`opam`](https://opam.ocaml.org):
```sh
opam install radare2
```
